## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
- `include/`: Contains the header files for the project.
- `data/`: Contains JSON configuration files for chess pieces and game settings.
- `third_party/`: Contains a third-party library, including the nlohmann JSON library.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the project.
- `.vscode/`: Contains configuration files for Visual Studio Code.

## Configuration

### Chess Pieces

Chess pieces are defined in JSON files located in the `data/` directory. Each piece has a type, starting positions for both colors, movement rules, and a count.

Example:
```json
{
  "type": "Pawn",
  "positions": {
    "white": [{"x": 0, "y": 1}, {"x": 1, "y": 1}],
    "black": [{"x": 0, "y": 6}, {"x": 1, "y": 6}]
  },
  "movement": {
    "forward": 1,
    "sideways": 0,
    "diagonal": 1,
    "l_shape": false,
    "first_move_forward": 2,
    "diagonal_capture": 1
  },
  "count": 8
}
```

### Portals

Portals are defined in the JSON configuration file and specify entry and exit positions, as well as properties like preserve direction and allowed colors.

Example:
```json
{
  "type": "Portal",
  "id": "portal1",
  "positions": {
    "entry": { "x": 3, "y": 3 },
    "exit": { "x": 5, "y": 5 }
  },
  "properties": {
    "preserve_direction": true,
    "allowed_colors": ["white", "black"],
    "cooldown": 1
  }
}
```
